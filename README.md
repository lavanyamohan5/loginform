# Modern Login & Registration UI

This is a simple **Login and Registration UI design** I built while learning web development.  
I found an open-source design online and explored its code to understand **form structures, input fields with icons, and responsive styling**.  

## ðŸ”‘ Features
- User registration form (Username, Email, Password)
- Login redirection
- Social media login buttons (Google, Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- Responsive and modern UI

## ðŸš€ My Learning Experience
- Learned how to style forms with icons inside input fields.
- Explored **flexbox & grid layouts** for centering content.
- Understood how to combine **UI + authentication flow**.
- Planning to integrate Firebase/Google authentication next.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
This project was inspired by open-source login page templates.  
I used the design as a learning resource and customized it to improve my understanding.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Add actual backend authentication (Firebase/Auth0).
- Implement form validation with JavaScript.
- Make it mobile-first responsive.
